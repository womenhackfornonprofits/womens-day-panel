        <h3>About WHFNP</h3>
        <p>
          <small>Women Hack for Non-Profits matchmakes skilled women in technology to open source projects for
                    non-profits, charities and individuals with a good social cause. By doing so, we aim to enhance the
                    skill set of Women in Tech to support their growth and increase their footprint in the open source
                    community.
                </small>
        </p>
        <p>
          <small>From planning and design to build and deployment, we offer non-profits a professional community
                    of volunteers dedicated to bringing life to meaningful projects.
                </small>
        </p>
        <p>
          <small>We provide our volunteers with a supportive environment to contribute and learn new skills
                    through real-world practice, a growing shared knowledge base, workshops and ongoing tech events. If
                    this sounds like something you are passionate about, join us!

        <h3>What is Parity?</h3>
        <p>
          <small>
                    Parity is the state or condition of being equal, especially as regards status or pay. Women all over
                    the world are still fighting for equality, not just economically but representation, media treatment
                    and many other ways.
                </small>
        </p>
        <h3>What does this mean to WHFNP?</h3>
        <p>
          <small>
                    The primary aim of WHFNP is encourage women to contribute to the open source community. Currently
                    the male to female ratio in technology roles in the UK is unbalanced, with women only taking up
                    roughly 14% of the roles in the industry.
                </small>
        </p>
        <p>
          <small>
                    Everyday our volunteers are actively striving to make that balance happen. Including taking part in
                    this panel discussion.
