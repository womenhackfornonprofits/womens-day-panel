          <h3>What is Parity?</h3>
          <p>
            <small>
              Parity is the state or condition of being equal, especially as regards status or pay. Women all over the world are still fighting for equality, not just economically but representation, media treatment and many other ways.
            </small>
          </p>
          <h3>What does this mean to WHFNP?</h3>
          <p>
            <small>
              The primary aim of WHFNP is encourage women to contribute to the open source community. Currently the male to female ratio in technology roles in the UK is unbalanced, with women only taking up roughly 14% of the roles in the industry.
            </small>
          </p>
          <p>
            <small>
              Everyday our volunteers are actively striving to make that balance happen. Including taking part in this panel discussion.
